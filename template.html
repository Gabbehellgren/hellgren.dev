                <p>This is my paragraph. 
                    There are many like it, but this one is mine.
                    My paragraph is my best friend. 
                    It is my life.
                    I must master it as must master my life.
                    My paragraph, without me, is useless.
                    Without my paragraph, I am useless.
                    I must write my paragraph true.
