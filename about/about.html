            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>Hi my name is Oscar! I am the owner, designer and programmer of this site.
                I was born in Sweden 2007 and currently attending my last year of highschool. 
                After highschool I want to continue my studies at universety, I am thinking of getting a master degree.
            </p>
            <p>In my free time I like to engineer, coding and designing. Something I also like very much is to train! 
                My main sport is canoing but I also do other sports such as climbing and cross-country skiing.
                I train alot and I have competed internationaly against our nordic neighbors. 
                I hope one day being able to compete in the olympics.
            </p>
