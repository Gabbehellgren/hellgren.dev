            <h2>Who I am</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Oscar.
                I was born in 2007 in Sweden, where I live.
                I grew up with my dad Janne and mom Julia, who lived with me, but I also have a half-brother.
                Since 2023, I have also been with my lovely girlfriend, Elsa.
                In 2024, I moved out and changed cities to a much bigger one, a 50-minute car ride away.
                There, I moved into a large one-room apartment, which is where I currently live.
            <p>
                As of today, I am attending my senior year of high school.
                After high school, I want to continue my studies at university with the intention of becoming an engineer.
                I also aspire to create my own company.
                Currently, I am not fluent in any programming language, but I am pretty confident in a few.
                These are:

                <ul>
                    <li>Python</li> 
                    <li>C-sharp (C#)</li> 
                    <li>HTML and CSS</li> 
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, I like to train, code, design, and engineer. 
                I train and compete in canoeing. 
                Training is something I do regularly; on a normal school week, I work out about 8â€“10 times.
                I usually train with my girlfriend. 
                I have competed a few times internationally and hope that one day I will compete at the Olympics. 
                In 2026, I will officially become a senior and compete at that level.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hope you found my story entertaining!
