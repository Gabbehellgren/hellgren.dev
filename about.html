                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Hi, my name is Oscar. 
                    I am from Sweden and I was born in 2007. 
                    I am the programmer and designer of hellgren.dev.
                    When I grew up I had both my parents and my half brother. 
                    Later we got a dog, a longhaired chiwawa named Nelly. Now I live alone in another city and I have a girlfriend.  
                </p>
                <p>Currently I attend my last year of highshool. 
                    I am studeing with a focus on technical areas. 
                    When I graduate I am planing on continuing my studies at universety, where I intend on doing a master.</p>

                <p>In my free time I like to coding, engineering and designing. 
                    I am not fluent in any programming language yet but I am familiar with a few. 
                    A example is python which I have had 1 basics course and is now doing a little more advanced course. I am also learing HTML and CSS.</p>

                <p>Another intrest of mine is canoing and training. I have competed and trained canoe since 2018/2019. 
                    I have particpated in national championsships aswell as been with the Swedish national team and competing against the other nordic countrys.
                    I started training in a canoe clubb in my home city but 2 years ago I changed to another clubb in another city.
                    This is the city where I now live. I met my girlfriend who also does canoing when I swiched clubb.</p>
