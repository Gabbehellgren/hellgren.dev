            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                This is hellgren.dev — a portfolio and personal website.
                Here, I will showcase, publish, and share my projects, as well as present new ideas.
                The site also features a gallery with photos from travels and other experiences.
            </p>

            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Oscar!  
                I own the domain <strong>hellgren.dev</strong> and I’m both the designer and developer behind this site.  
                I was born in 2007 in Sweden, and right now I’m in my senior year of high school.  
                After graduation, I plan to continue studying at university with the goal of becoming an engineer.  

            <br><br>

                I’ve always been into tech — in my free time I enjoy coding and building different projects, and I’m also really into 3D printing.  
                Outside of tech, I spend a lot of time training and competing in canoeing. I usually work out once a day and have competed in the Nordic Championships a few times.  
                I started paddling back in 2018, and my dream is to one day reach the Olympics. Starting from the autumn regatta in 2025, I’ll be competing as a senior.  

            <br><br>

                I wouldn’t say I’m fluent in any programming language yet, but I feel pretty confident in a few, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>C#</li>
                <li>HTML & CSS</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I’ve also been learning my way around Linux Ubuntu without a graphical interface, which has been a fun challenge and a great learning experience.  
            </p>
