    <h1>This is hellgren.dev</h1>
    <p>Owner/Developer: Oscar Hellgren</p>
    <p>hellgren.dev is currently under construction.</p>
    <p>This page will be used to distribute my projects and serve as a portfolio.</p>
    <p>I hope this website will become a professional way for me to express my work.</p>
    <p>hellgren.dev might not be fully functional yet, but I hope that along with my current project VEGA, it will become operable soon.</p>
