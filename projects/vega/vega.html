                <h3>3.1 Background</h3>
                <p>It all began when I got the idea that I needed cloud storage and wanted to be able to access my personal files quickly wherever I was.
                    I started to do research on possible solutions, and then I discovered VPNs. Immediately I started fantasizing about the different use cases. 
                </p>
                <h3>3.2 What is a VPN?</h3>
                <p>A VPN or Virtual Encrypted Network is a sort of "fake" network between the user and server.
                    This fake network is called a tunnel. The tunnel is private, which means that it is only used between a user/group of users and the server.
                    It is also encrypted, meaning that the packets or "messages" are distorted in a specific way and then sent. Upon receipt the message can be decrypted, i.e. the message is returned to its original form.
                    Encryption is good because you need the correct "key," "pattern," or "instructions" to decrypt and read it. This means that people who are not meant to access the packet cannot read it, because it is just a distorted mess.
                    <br>Earlier I said that a VPN is a fake network. To explain, you can think of your phone.
                    You search www.hellgren.dev — this becomes a request sent to your router (a computer that handles requests and sends information to the right device). The router then gives you the data you requested (searched for).
                    It is the same way with a VPN:<br><br>
                    The user requests some data → the request is encrypted → sent to the server → the server decrypts → the server gets the data → encrypts → sends to the user → user decrypts → the user gets the data.
                </p>
                <h3>3.3 Areas of use that are beneficial to me</h3>
                <p>There are multiple uses for VPNs and many could benefit me.
                    Here I will list some of them:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Able to set up private cloud storage - [Obsolete] I now use GitHub</li>
                        <li>Accessing and maintaining servers from anywhere - [Very useful]</li>
                        <li>Accessing and configuring home network - [Very useful]</li>
                        <li>Being able to LAN with my friends - [Very useful]</li>
                        <li>More secure and private network - [Fine] It is good, but I don't really care</li>
                        <li>Bypass public networks (schools) firewalls - [Useful]</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>3.4 Why I chose WireGuard</h3>
                <p>When I began my "research" I started by trying to set up OpenVPN, but it proved to be a hard and slow configuration.
                    I then did some searching and found that there are many VPN protocols like OpenVPN, IPSec, and WireGuard.
                    I looked into the options and found that WireGuard, unlike the others, is really fast, still secure, and yet a very simple protocol.
                    So every fact pointed towards WireGuard:                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>Fast</li>
                        <li>Secure</li>
                        <li>Easy and fast configuration</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <h3>3.5 What is WireGuard?</h3>
                <p>
                WireGuard is a modern, fast, and secure VPN protocol that is designed 
                to be simpler than traditional solutions like OpenVPN or IPSec. It uses 
                state-of-the-art cryptography and is built directly into the Linux kernel, 
                which makes it lightweight and efficient. Unlike older VPNs, WireGuard is easy 
                to configure and provides high performance with minimal overhead, making it a 
                popular choice for both personal and enterprise use.

                <h3>3.6 Why build my own software?</h3>
                <p>I chose to build my own software because I wanted to be able to share my VPN with my friends.
                    But I wanted to control when and how long my "clients" used my VPN.
                    I want control because I do not want others to surf on my personal network.
                    That might make me responsible for what they do on the internet.
                    I want to be able to share my VPN without compromising myself.
                    It would also be a sleeker way to share the VPN and it would mean that I do not have to share my public IP as much.
                </p>
                <h3>3.7 Development</h3>
                <p><p>To clarify, I do not intend on making my own VPN protocol. 
                    Rather, VEGA is extra logic that interacts with the WireGuard protocol.</p>
                    I chose to develop VEGA in C# because it would be a fun learning experience and I could use Avalonia for a nice GUI.
                    VEGA is going to be distributed here on the downloads page.
