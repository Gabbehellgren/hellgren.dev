                <h3>3.1 Background</h3>
                <p>It all began when I got the idea that I needed cloudstorage and be able to access my personal files fast where ever I at.
                    I started to do research on the possible solutions, I then discoverd VPN:S. Imidiatly I started fantasising about the different use cases. 
                </p>
                <h3>3.2 What is a VPN?</h3>
                <p>A VPN or Virtual Encrypted Network, is a sort of "fake" network between the user and server.
                    This fake network is call
                    
                    ed a tunnel. The tunnel is private, this means that the tunnel is only used between a user/group of users and the server.
                    It is also encrypted and this means that the packages or "messeges" are distorted in a specific way and then sent, on recive the message can be decrypted aka the message is returned to it original.
                    Encrytion is good because you have to have the right "key", "pattern" or "instructions" to decrypt and read it, this means that people that are not ment to access the package can not read it because it is just a distorted mess.
                    <br>Earlier I said that VPN is a fake network, to explain you can think of your phone.
                    You search www.hellgren.dev this becomes a request sent to your router (a computer that handles requests and sends information to the right device) the router then give you the data you requested (searched).
                    It is the same way with VPN:<br><br>
                    The user requests some data → the request is encrypted → sent to the server → the server decrypts → the server gets the data → encrypts → send to user → user decrypts → the user got the data.

                <h3>3.4 Why I choosed wireguard</h3>
                <h3>3.5 What is wireguard?</h3>
                <p>
                WireGuard is a modern, fast, and secure VPN protocol that is designed 
                to be simpler than traditional solutions like OpenVPN or IPSec. It uses 
                state-of-the-art cryptography and is built directly into the Linux kernel, 
                which makes it lightweight and efficient. Unlike older VPNs, WireGuard is easy 
                to configure and provides high performance with minimal overhead, making it a 
                popular choice for both personal and enterprise use.
