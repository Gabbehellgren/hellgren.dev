                I started to research and experiment with VPN solutions.
                My goal was to get access to my apartments home network.
                By connecting to my home network I planed to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Private cloudstorage</li>
                <li>Setting up lan with my friends</li>
                <li>Accessing, maintaining and manage servers</li>
                <li>Manage the home network</li>
                <li>Accesing devices</li>
                <li>Bypassing restriction of certain network trafic</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I began my work using the <a href="https://openvpn.net/">OpenVPN</a> ðŸ”— protocol. 
                But the OpenVPN protocol showed to be hard to set up therefore I looked at other protocols.
                I finaly found the <a href="https://wireguard.com/">Wireguard</a> ðŸ”— protocol.
                This protocol showed to be alot faster and easier to set up compared to others while still providing a high level of security.
                Wireguard has faster transfer speeds then competetors. 
                When I finaly got the result I wanted I started to look at the use cases.
                Many of the items in the above list was easy to complete but I was uncertain about the Lan one.
                It could be easy, just make my friends download the windows gui version of wireguard. 
                Yes, this way would be easiest but the most unsecure. 
                It demanded that I exposed my public ip via messages and I had little control over the clients.
                Thats when I got an idea:
            </p>
            <h2>The idÃ©a</h2>
            <p>
                Develop my own VPN app using wireguard protocol. 
                The app would enable me to more exactly keep track which client was who.
                I would be able to send messages to the clients and
            </p>
